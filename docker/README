Configure:
_ Add to gwt-client/config/mapfish/config.yaml to enable map printing:
  - !dnsMatch
    host: <your-host>
    port: <your-host-port>


Build and run:

$ cd docker
$ docker compose up

Lookup the allocated host port:

$ docker compose port wiki 80

The application should now be accessible on your docker host
(e.g. http://your-host:your-host-port).
See docker/flys_user_file for credentials.

In case an Oracle database should be used, the server service has to be
build with a build-time argument:

$ docker compose build --build-arg ORACLE=true artifacts

Remote debugging:

To enable remote debugging of the artifact server, uncomment the respective
lines in docker-compose.yml, recreate the service and e.g. attach with JDB:
$ docker compose up -d
$ jdb -attach <your-docker-host>:8787 -sourcepath<your-checkout>/artifacts/src/main/java


TODO:
_ Avoid having to change configuration manually
_ Something better than setting framework and http-client to a branch
  explicitly in the Dockerfiles
